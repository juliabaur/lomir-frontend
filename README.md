# Lomir — Frontend

React single-page application for **Lomir**, a team-matching platform that helps people find collaborators based on shared interests, skills, badges, and location.

Built with React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.

## Live Demo

**Try it now:** [lomir-frontend.vercel.app](https://lomir-frontend.vercel.app)

> The backend runs on Render's free tier and enters sleep mode after inactivity. The first request may take 15–30 seconds to wake up — after that, everything responds normally.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ and npm
- The [Lomir backend](https://github.com/KasparSinitsin/Lomir-backend) running on `http://localhost:5001`

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KasparSinitsin/Lomir-frontend.git
cd Lomir-frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# API connection
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001

# Optional Socket.IO override (defaults to VITE_API_URL if unset)
# VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5001

# ImageKit (image/file uploads — get values from the project owner)
VITE_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=<your-public-key>
VITE_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/<your-id>

# Cloudflare Turnstile (optional for local dev — if unset, CAPTCHA is not shown)
# VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=<turnstile-site-key>
```

> Get the ImageKit values from the project owner.

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app starts on `http://localhost:5173` with hot module replacement.

## Key Pages

| Route | Page | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Landing Page | Public homepage with feature overview |
| `/search` | Search | Find teams, users, and roles; list/map toggle; advanced filtering by tags, badges, distance |
| `/teams/my-teams` | My Teams | Teams you belong to, pending invitations and applications |
| `/profile` | Profile | Edit your profile, tags, avatar, and location |
| `/profile/:id` | Public Profile | View any user's profile; shows placeholder for deleted/missing users |
| `/chat` | Chat | Direct messages and team group chat with file sharing |
| `/badges` | Badges | Browse all 30 badges across 5 categories |
| `/settings` | Settings | Change password and delete account |

---

## Search & Matching

The search page supports multiple sort and filter modes:

**Sort options:** Name (A–Z / Z–A), Newest, Recently updated, Best Match, Proximity (nearest / remote first), Capacity (member slots or open roles)

**Filter options:** Filter by tags, filter by badges, distance radius, open roles only, exclude teams you're already in, include/exclude demo data

**Best Match scoring** uses the backend matching engine (tag overlap 40%, badge overlap 30%, distance 30%) and falls back to client-side profile overlap calculations when backend scores aren't available.

**Map view** renders all results on a Leaflet map with color-coded markers. Clicking a marker shows a popup with the team/user/role card. Distance indicators show how far each result is from your location.

---

## Account Deletion

The deletion flow in Settings follows a three-step process:

1. **Password confirmation** — Validates identity before showing any impact data
2. **Impact preview** — Shows teams to be transferred (with successor override), teams to be deleted, roles to be reopened, and affected counts
3. **Confirm & execute** — Triggers the backend transaction; on success, logs out and redirects to home

All components handle deleted user references gracefully: chat messages show "Former Lomir User" with a grey avatar, badge awards preserve the badge but show a null awarder, and profile links show a placeholder page.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS errors** — Make sure the backend is running on port 5001 and the frontend on 5173; check that `VITE_API_URL` matches
- **Socket.IO won't connect** — Verify `VITE_SOCKET_URL` in `.env` if you set it; otherwise the client falls back to `VITE_API_URL`
- **"Access denied. No token provided."** — Your JWT has expired; log out and log back in
- **CAPTCHA not showing locally** — Expected behavior; if `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` is unset, registration skips CAPTCHA
- **Images not uploading** — Check that `VITE_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VITE_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT` are set in `.env`
- **Map not rendering** — Leaflet CSS must be imported; check that `leaflet` and `react-leaflet` are installed
